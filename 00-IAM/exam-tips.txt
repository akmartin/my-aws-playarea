IAM is universa. It does not ap to o this time
The "Root Account" is simply the account created when you first set up your aws account. It has complete admin access
New users have no permissions when first created
New users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys when first created
They are not the same as the user id and password. You cannot log in to your console using the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You can use this to access AWS via APIs and command line
You only get to view these once. If you lose them you have to regenerate them. So save them in a secure location
Always setup multifactor authentication for your root account
You can create and customize your password rotation policies
