CloudFront: A Content Delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and their web content to a user based on geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.

EDGE LOCATION: This is the location where content will be cached. This is seperate to an AWS Region/Availability Zone.
- Edge Locations are not just READ ONLY - you can WRITE to them too.
- Objects are cached for the TTL (Time To Live - in secs)
- You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged ***

ORIGIN: This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be a S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route 53.

DISTRIBUTION: This is the name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.
There are 2 types of distributions in CloudFront:
- Web distribution - Typically used for websites
- RTMP - Used for media streaming

Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance
