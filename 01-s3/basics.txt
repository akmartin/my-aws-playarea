S3 - Simple Storage Service

- It is a safe place to store your files
- It is object-based storage
- The data is divided across multiple devices and facilities

Basics of S3:
- It is object based - ie it allows you to upload files
- Files can be from 0bytes to 5TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets (folders)
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is names must be unique globally
- http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
- When you upload a file to S3 - you will receive a http 200 code if the upload was successful

S3 objects consist of the following:
- Key (This is simply the name of the object)
- Value (This is simply the data that is made up of the sequence of bytes)
- Version ID (important for versioning)
- Metadata (Data about data you are storing)

Data consistency in S3:
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  (If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data)
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(might take a while to propogate)
  (If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version or you may not. Changes to objects takes a little bit of time to propogate)
