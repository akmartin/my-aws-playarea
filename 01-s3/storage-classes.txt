S3 IA ------
(Infrequently accessed)
For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. lower fee than S3, but you will be charged a retrieval fee
- Minimum capacity charge per object: N/A
- Minimum storage duration charge: 30days
- Retrieval fee: N/A
- First byte latency: milliseconds

S3 One Zone-IA ------
