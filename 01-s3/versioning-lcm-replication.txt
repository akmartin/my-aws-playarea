Using versioning with S3:
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with lifecycle rules
- Versioning's MFA DELETE capability, which used multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security

Life Cycle Management (LCM)
- Automates moving the objects between the different storage tiers
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning

Cross Region Replication
- To add replication for an S3 bucket, versioning has to be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
- once cross region replication is set any existing files in the bucket are not replicated.
- Any new file added to the bucket after replication is set is automatically replicated across regions.
- if a file is marked for deletion in the bucket the 'marked for deletion' is not replicated.
- Older files existing in the bucket before setting replication on it will have to be manually copied to the replication buckets.
- Deletion of individual versions of files are also NOT replicated
