You can select AMI based on the foloowing criteria:
- Region (Regions and Availability Zones)
- Operating System
- Architecture (32-bit, 64-bit)
- Launch Permissions
- Storage foir root device (Root Device Volume)
   Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE)
   EBS Backed volumes

All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by Instance store

For EBS Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot

For Instance Store Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Instance Store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3


- Instance Store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails you will lose your data 
- EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance is it is stopped
- You can reboot both, you will not lose data
- By default both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However with EBS volumes you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
